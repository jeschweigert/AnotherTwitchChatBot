# AnotherTwitchChatBot
a command line twitch chat bot built in C#.
featuring a full playlist/song request system, legit Twitch account authentication through OAuth, extreme portability, and very low CPU usage!
while it starts off barebones, you can easily create your own chat commands in C# using the plugin system.

more documentation to come as the project develops, but feel free to hit me up on [twitter](http://twitter.com/sand_head) if you have any questions until then.
